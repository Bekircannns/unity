# Research Decision Summary

Source: deep research report shared by the team.

## Why Restore Rush now
- Strong fit for hybrid-casual monetization
- Very clear UGC hook (before/after transformation)
- Solo-dev friendly MVP scope in 4-6 weeks
- Low implementation risk versus heavy strategy genres

## Fallback option
Dice Builder Lucky Blocks remains the backup if KPI gates fail.

## Platform and launch strategy
- Build and test first on Android from Windows
- Use Mac mini only for iOS signing and TestFlight work
- Start with UGC-first growth and run only small paid creative tests

## Immediate execution priorities
1. Build one-level vertical slice fast
2. Instrument analytics from day one
3. Generate and test UGC hooks in parallel
4. Use KPI gates for objective product decisions
